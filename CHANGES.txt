Handle slf4j gracefully

PropertiesFileConfig noew searches both local file system (old behaviour) and the root of the classpath

======

The block
          try {
                   ejb.startJetty();
                   ejb.verifyServerStartup();
               } catch (Exception e) {
                   //noinspection ThrowableResultOfMethodCallIgnored
                   propagate(e);
               }


    can now be simplified to ejb.startJetty();
