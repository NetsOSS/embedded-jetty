1.2
====
Setting -Dembedded.jetty.daemon=true will launch embedded jetty with all daemon threads, which may be nice when running from within maven.

This would permit something like:

mvn org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:1.2.1:java -Dexec.mainClass=eu.nets.vas.StartJetty -Dembedded.jetty.daemon=false

Which will start your jetty starter and keep it running for the duration of your build.

Make sure your application also uses daemon threads or it won't terminate.

1.1
===
Added support for lifecycle listeners

Jetty8 version that is aligned with 1.2

Handle slf4j gracefully

0.16
======
PropertiesFileConfig noew searches both local file system (old behaviour) and the root of the classpath
(new behaviour) for environment.properties. Local file system has precedence

0.15
======
The capture of stdout/stderr did not properly diffrentiate between the two.

0.14
======

The block
          try {
                   ejb.startJetty();
                   ejb.verifyServerStartup();
               } catch (Exception e) {
                   //noinspection ThrowableResultOfMethodCallIgnored
                   propagate(e);
               }


    can now be simplified to ejb.startJetty();


0.13
======

Deferred initialization of web app context until servletcontext was actually available, to fix
issue with spring mvc.
