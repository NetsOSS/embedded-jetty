Note: SSL support has not yet been properly ported from shared-server. If you server needs to
implement ssl you will need to patch this.

1.2.4 (TBR)
===
- Disabled NIO (file locking on windows) for static resources in devmode. Requires jetty 9.0.4 for this to work,
ignored otherwise.

1.2.3
===
- Added method that accepts filterHolder

1.2.2
===
Fixed https://jira.bbs.no/jira/browse/EMBEDDEDJETTY-1


1.2.1
===
Added nice thread pool name to the embedded-jetty threads
1.2
====
Setting -Dembedded.jetty.daemon=true will launch embedded jetty with all daemon threads, which may be nice when running from within maven.

This would permit something like:

mvn org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:1.2.1:java -Dexec.mainClass=eu.nets.vas.StartJetty -Dembedded.jetty.daemon=false

Which will start your jetty starter and keep it running for the duration of your build.

Make sure your application also uses daemon threads or it won't terminate.

1.1
===
Added support for lifecycle listeners



1.0
====
Jetty 9 version.

0.21
====
Fixed problem with daemon threads for jetty8 branch

0.20
====
Jetty8 version that is aligned with 1.2

0.19
====
Added ServerUtil from shared-server because we need it. It's the only thing we need.

0.18
===
Fixed bug in isStartedWithAppassembler

0.17
====
Handle slf4j gracefully

0.16
======
PropertiesFileConfig noew searches both local file system (old behaviour) and the root of the classpath
(new behaviour) for environment.properties. Local file system has precedence

0.15
======
The capture of stdout/stderr did not properly diffrentiate between the two.

0.14
======

The block
          try {
                   ejb.startJetty();
                   ejb.verifyServerStartup();
               } catch (Exception e) {
                   //noinspection ThrowableResultOfMethodCallIgnored
                   propagate(e);
               }


    can now be simplified to ejb.startJetty();


0.13
======

Deferred initialization of web app context until servletcontext was actually available, to fix
issue with spring mvc.
